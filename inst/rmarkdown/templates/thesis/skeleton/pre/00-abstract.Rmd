This study explores the usefulness of multiple cross-validation and bootstrap methods as tools to select between various short forms of binary Rasch and 2parameter logistic (2PL) tests, using classification error to an external criterion variable as the selection criteria. A simulation study is performed in R to investigate how these methods perform across multiple sample sizes within the two test models by comparing the error estimates to an out-sample error estimate over 100 iterations. A total of 13 methods are tested in the Rasch framework and 9 in the 2PL framework. The results show that while the methods are able to accurately choose the short forms that produce the lowest error under all conditions, the simple resubstitution error and leave-one-out cross-validation have the smallest bias overall. Explanations for the results and suggested areas of future research are provided in the discussion section.
