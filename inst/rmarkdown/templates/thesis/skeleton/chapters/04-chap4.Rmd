## Rasch Model Results  

Tables 4-1 and 4-2 show the mean error and variance estimates for each of the methods across each condition. The out-sample error is excluded from Table 4-2 as its values would be zero by definition. The methods are relatively similar within each condition for both the mean and variance of the error estimates and show similar trends across sample sizes and test forms. Tables 4-3 through 4-5 demonstrate how the bias of the methods change as sample size changes, while Table 4-6 gives the mean bias across all conditions. The methods tend to underestimate the error in the 50n conditions, approximate the error in the 100n conditions, and overestimate the error in the 200n conditions. Notable exceptions are the LOOCV and 5B 10-Fold conditions, which overestimated the error in 50n conditions, and the $e_0$ and .632 bootstrap, which both overestimated the error in the 50n and 100n conditions. Overall bias, however, is approximately zero for each of the procedures except the $e_0$ and .632 bootstrap, which have noticeably greater overall bias. Table 4-7 shows the percentage of conditions in which eRm did not estimate Rasch model parameters because of the similarity of the response patterns within that condition. 

Figures 4-1 through 4-4 show the distributions of the error estimates across the conditions for each method, with each figure including the out-sample error for comparison. These figures demonstrate that each method’s distribution changes in a similar manner across sample sizes and test short forms. Figures 4-5 through 4-7 invert the factors, showing the distributions of the errors across the methods for each condition while including a dashed line for the mean out-sample error and a dotted line for the minimum and maximum values. These figures demonstrate how the methods approximate the mean and variance of the out-sample error better as sample size increases. 

## 2PL Model Results 

Tables 4-8 and 4-9 show the mean error and variance estimates of each method. All of the methods produced error estimates higher than the out-sample error for the full 30-item test, but are closer to the out-sample error for the subtests. The mean errors become more similar as sample size increases for each method, though the errors in the 30-item conditions are noticeably greater than the out-sample error. Tables 4-10 through 4-11 show the bias of the methods under each sample size and Table 4-12 produces the mean bias across all sample sizes. Similar to the previous tables, there is more noticeable differences across methods under the 100n conditions, but as sample size increases the differences become smaller, resulting in relatively similar overall bias. The exception to this is the 5 bootstrap 10-fold method: this method’s bias is noticeably higher for the 100n and 200n conditions but is more similar once sample size reaches 500.  

Figures 4-8 through 4-10 show the distributions of the error estimates across the conditions for each method with each figure including the out-sample error for comparison. The box plots for each method become smaller as sample size increases, showing that the distribution of each methods’ estimates decreases as sample size increases. Figures 4-11 through 4-13 show the distributions of the errors across the methods for each condition while including a dashed line for the mean out-sample error and a dotted line for the minimum and maximum values. These plots show that, as sample size increases, more of the methods’ distributions of error becomes contained within the range of the out-sample error.
