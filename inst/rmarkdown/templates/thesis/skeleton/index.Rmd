Above is the YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) header that includes a lot of metadata used to produce the document.  Be careful with spacing in this header!

If you'd like to include a comment that won't be produced in your resulting file enclose it in a block like this.

If you receive a duplicate label error after knitting, make sure to delete the index.Rmd file and then knit again.

```{r include_packages, include = FALSE}
# This chunk ensures that the gatordown package is
# installed and loaded. This package includes
# the template files for the thesis in a UF-approved
# format.
if(!require(devtools))
  install.packages("devtools", repos = "http://cran.rstudio.com")
if(!require(gatordown))
  devtools::install_github("AnthonyRaborn/gatordown")
library(gatordown)
```

<!-- 
You'll need to include the order that you'd like Rmd files to appear in the
_bookdown.yml file for PDF files and also delete the # before rmd_files: there.
These are considered the BODY of the thesis.
-->

<!--
For citations from the .bib file, you'll want to include the LaTeX commands to cite.

For IN-TEXT citations, use \citet{key}. For example, if the key for "Jones et al., 1990" 
was jones1990, then \citet{jones1990} would output "Jones et al. (1990)" in the final pdf.

For PARENTHETICAL citations, ,use \citep{key}. With the same example key, typing 
\citep{jones1990} would output "(Jones et al., 2000)".

You can use a comma "," to include multiple citations.

Obviously, the end result will be dependent on your .csl file you included!
