This is a LaTex template derived from the beavtex template found on the Oregon
State University Math Department website. Only three things have changed:

 - I changed the code of the beavtex.cls to include dots for subchapters in the
   TOC
 - I added the **rotating** package to allow for rotating charts that were too
   wide
 - I added the **tablefootnote** package to allow for footnotes in tables

Other than that, the Grad School has approved the pretext pages as of December
2013. Good luck!

2016: This template is now a markdown template.
