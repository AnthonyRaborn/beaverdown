% This is the Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work
% for the document class was done by Sam Noble (SN), as well as this
% template. Later comments etc. by Ben Salzberg (BTS). Additional
% restructuring and APA support by Jess Youngberg (JY).
% Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome; please email
% them to cus@reed.edu
%
% See http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex.html for help. There are a
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment.
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes
% to yourself and explaining commands.
% Commenting also removes a line from the document;
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% As far as I know, this follows the requirements laid out in
% the 2002-2003 Senior Handbook. Ask a librarian to check the
% document before binding. -SN

%\abstract{This is a LaTex template derived from the beavtex template found on the Oregon State University Math Department website. Only three things have changed:
% \begin{itemize}
% \item I changed the code of the beavtex.cls to include dots for subchapters in the TOC
% \item I added the \textbf{rotating} package to allow for rotating charts that were too wide
% \item I added the \textbf{tablefootnote} package to allow for footnotes in tables
% \end{itemize}
% Other than that, the Grad School has approved the pretext pages as of December 2013. Good luck!}
